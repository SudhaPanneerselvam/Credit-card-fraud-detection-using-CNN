# Credit-card-fraud-detection-using-CNN
The CNN model is trained on historical transaction data, using labeled examples of fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, and then applied to predict fraud on new transactions.
# Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to automatically detect fraudulent credit card transactions based on historical data. The CNN model will learn patterns and relationships from past transactions to identify potential fraud in new, unseen transactions.
# Key Features
Fraudulent transactions make up a very small portion of the overall dataset.

Transaction data (such as amount, time, location, etc.) is reshaped into a grid or matrix-like structure to allow the CNN to process it. 

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply filters to transaction data to detect key patterns across features, such as relationships between transaction time, amount, and location.

CNN-based fraud detection model is robust, adaptable, and effective at identifying fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and low false positives.
# Requirements
* Hardware Requirements
* Computer/Server: Intel Core i5 or higher, 8 GB RAM
Software Requirements
Operating System: Windows
Programming Languages: Python
Integrated Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook.
# Installation 
Install Python: Download and install Python from the official website.
Set Up Virtual Environment (Optional): Create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
Install Required Libraries: Install TensorFlow (or PyTorch) along with essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.
(Optional) GPU Setup: If you have an NVIDIA GPU, install CUDA and cuDNN for faster model training.
Download Dataset: Get the credit card fraud dataset from Kaggle to start working on the project.
# Usage
Feed the preprocessed transaction data (e.g., amount, time, location) into the trained CNN model.
The model analyzes the transaction and classifies it as either fraudulent or legitimate based on learned patterns.
Flag fraudulent transactions for further investigation or immediate action, such as blocking the transaction or alerting the user.
# Procedure
Data Collection: Gather a dataset of credit card transactions, which includes both legitimate and fraudulent transactions (e.g., from Kaggle).
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, scaling features (like transaction amount), and addressing class imbalance using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
Model Design: Build a CNN model with layers such as convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, designed to learn patterns in the transaction data.
Model Training: Train the CNN model on the preprocessed data, using optimization algorithms like Adam to adjust model weights based on prediction accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Test the model on unseen data and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time, flagging suspicious activity for further investigation.
